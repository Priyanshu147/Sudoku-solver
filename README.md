# Sudoku Solver

This Java code defines a program for solving Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle, where the goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as regions or boxes) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

Here's a breakdown of the code's main components and functionality:

1. `display` method:
   - This method is responsible for displaying the current state of the Sudoku board.
   - It uses ANSI escape codes for terminal text coloration to make the output visually appealing.
   - It prints the Sudoku board, with each cell's value in either cyan or yellow color, separated by vertical and horizontal lines.

2. `solve` method:
   - This is the main recursive method that attempts to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
   - It takes the current Sudoku board, row (`i`), and column (`j`) as parameters.
   - The method progresses through the grid, trying to fill in valid numbers (1-9) in empty cells.
   - If it successfully fills in the entire board, it prints the solution.
   - If the board cannot be solved, it backtracks by resetting a cell's value to 0 and continues exploring other possibilities.

3. `isValid` method:
   - This method checks whether it's valid to place a number (`val`) in a specific cell (`x`, `y`) of the Sudoku board.
   - It checks three conditions: row, column, and subgrid (3x3 box). If the number already exists in any of these conditions, it returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.

4. `main` method:
   - The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
   - It initializes a 9x9 Sudoku board with a starting configuration. The provided example is a typical Sudoku puzzle.
   - Alternatively, you can uncomment a section of code to input the Sudoku puzzle from the console using a `Scanner`.
   - It displays the initial state of the Sudoku board and then calls the `solve` method to find a solution.
   - If a solution is found, it is printed. Otherwise, it prints "No solution possible" if no valid solution exists.

Overall, this code provides a Sudoku solver that uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the solution to the puzzle. It is capable of solving most standard Sudoku puzzles and provides a visual representation of the solved board using colored text.
